    "## Introduction\n",
    "Gridded population data is created by taking census data, which is typically collected at the administrative unit level, and distributing that population across a grid of raster cells. Census, that becomes the primary source of population data, provides counts of people within specific administrative boundaries (e.g., counties, districts). Using a certain method, the population within each administrative unit is distributed across the grid cells that intersect with that unit. This method is known as top-down approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major methods to distribute or disaggregate population into grid cells:\n",
    "- **Areal Weighting**: This common method assumes a uniform population distribution within each administrative unit and allocates population to grid cells based on the proportion of the unit's area covered by each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dasymetric Mapping**: This method uses ancillary data (e.g., land cover, building density) to refine the population distribution within administrative units, resulting in a more realistic representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dasymetric mapping becomes a method to create accurate and reliable gridded population datasets like [WorldPop Global Project Population Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WorldPop_GP_100m_pop#image-properties) and [LandScan Population Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/projects_sat-io_open-datasets_ORNL_LANDSCAN_GLOBAL). This method leverages additional information, called ancillary data, to more accurately reallocate the original data within these areas. The goal is to achieve a distribution that better reflects the true spatial pattern of the phenomenon being mapped. Ancillary data is the crucial ingredient that distinguishes dasymetric mapping. It consists of spatial datasets that correlate with the distribution of the source data. Common examples include:\n",
    "- Land cover/land use data: Identifying areas unsuitable for human habitation (e.g., water bodies, forests) or with varying population densities (e.g., urban vs. rural).\n",
    "- Building footprints/density data: Indicating areas with higher potential for population concentration.\n",
    "- Nighttime lights data: Suggesting areas of human activity and potential population presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the available ancillary data, the population count at administrative unit level is then proportionally redistributed within this zones."

    "## Input data\n",
    "In this tutorial, we aim for disaggregating population of Skaane County in Sweden using two ancillary data:\n",
    "- [VIIRS Nighttime Composite](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_VIIRS_DNB_ANNUAL_V21) representing the amount of lights emitted from the Earth's surface as measured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard Suomi NPP satellite. The dataset contains several bands, including the average nighttime radiance to be used for dasymetric disaggregation. It has a spatial resolution of around 500 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [GHSL Global Building Volume](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GHSL_P2023A_GHS_BUILT_V) depicts the global distribution of building volume, expressed in cubic metres per 100 m grid cell. Following the characteristics of the building, i.e., residential and non-residential, we can estimate the building volume allocated for residential use, which is relevant for population disaggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [WorldPop Global Project Population Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WorldPop_GP_100m_pop#image-properties) as the basis. The total population of Blekinge County (admin-1) and the population counts at every subcounty (admin-2) are obtained through zonal statistics using appropriate administrative boundaries. The [Global Administrative Unit Layer](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_2015_level2) contains administrative boundaries we can use to define the region of interest for this tutorial."
